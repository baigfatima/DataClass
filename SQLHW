#1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.
use sakila; 
select first_name, last_name from actor; 

#* 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.
use sakila; 
select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as Actor_Name
from actor; 

#* 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
use sakila; 
select actor_id, first_name, last_name
from actor
where first_name = 'Joe";

#* 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:
use sakila; 
select last_name 
from actor
where last_name like 'GEN';
 
#* 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
use sakila; 
select last_name
from actor
where last_name like 'LI'
order by last_name, first_name; 

#* 2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
use sakila; 
select country_id, country
from country
where country in ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China')

#* 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).
alter table actor
add description blob

#* 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.
alter table actor 
drop column description 

#* 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
select last_name, count(last_name) as "Count of Last Name"

select last_name, count(last_name) as "Count of Last Name" 
from actor
group by last_name
having count(last_name) >=2;

#* 4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.
update actor
set first_name = 'Harpo'
where first_namee = 'Groucho' and last_name = 'Williams';

#* 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.
update actor 
set first_name = case 
	when first_name = 'Harpo'
    then 'Groucho'
    end 
where actor_id = 172;

#* 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
